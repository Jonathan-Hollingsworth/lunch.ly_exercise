# lunch.ly_exercise

This uses object-oriented node-pg to ensure any instances of sql are not found within any routes.  

lunch.ly allows you to add and edit customers as well as make reservations for those customers. (In a web page, not an API)
>> You will need to have a `lunchly` database made beforehand
